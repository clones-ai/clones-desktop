# Welcome to the Clones Developer Guide

Welcome to the Clones project! We are excited that you're interested in contributing. This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment and show you how to get involved with the community.

## Why Contribute?

CLONES is building the next frontier of automation: "A world where anyone can train, tokenize, and execute their own digital agent capable of replicating anything a human can do on a computer."

This marks the evolution from LLMs (Large Language Models) to VLMs (Vision Large Action Models)â€”from thinking agents to doing agents. While AI can already write, Computer Use Agents (CUAs) can now act, replicating entire human workflows across desktop environments.

Every person, every profession will be able to clone their know-how into a digital agent (a "clone") that works for them 24/7, powering the next generation of the AI workforce.

Our mission is to democratize access to this technology by letting anyone:

Record a workflow -> Convert it into a dataset -> Fine-tune a model -> Tokenize an agent -> Run it

## Project History

The Clones project is a continuation of the work started by [Viralmind](https://github.com/viralmind-ai). A first major step was migrating the desktop application from Svelte to Flutter. Subsequently, the original monorepo containing the backend and website was split into two separate repositories. The project is currently undergoing a significant refactoring effort to update its vocabulary, enhance security, and remove legacy code.

## Getting Started: Local Setup

To contribute, you'll first need to set up the project locally. The Clones ecosystem consists of three main components. Follow these guides to get them running:

-   **[Backend Setup Guide](./projects/backend.mdx)**: Instructions for the server-side application.
-   **[Website Setup Guide](./projects/website.mdx)**: Instructions for the web front-end.
-   **[Desktop Setup Guide](./projects/desktop.mdx)**: Instructions for the desktop application.

## How to Contribute

Once your local environment is set up, you're ready to start contributing!

1.  Join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/viralmind) and introduce yourself.
2.  We'll help you find good first issues to work on.
3.  Create your account on [Only Dust](https://www.onlydust.com/).

### Becoming a Core Contributor

After a few qualitative contributions, we may invite you to join the core team and become a maintainer of the project.

## A Note on Active Development

# Clones Desktop

A desktop application for contributing to the world's largest dataset for multimodal computer-use agents. Earn $CLONES, $USDC or $SOL tokens in two ways: record your desktop interactions to train better computer-use AI, or provide secure virtual desktop infrastructure for deploying these agents.

Built from the ground up with privacy and security as core principles. See our [Privacy Policy](../../PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clones-sol/desktop.git
cd desktop
```

## Development

This project is a monorepo containing the Flutter application and the Rust backend.

### Prerequisites

-   [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) - Flutter 3.29+
-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:
    -   [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)
    -   [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
-   The [backend server](../projects/backend.mdx) and [website](../projects/website.mdx) must be running. Using the recommended Docker setup for both is advised.

### Application Setup (Flutter + Rust)

#### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `desktop` project directory by copying the `env.example` file.

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

For local development, the default values in this file do not need to be changed.

#### 2. Run the Application

The recommended way to run the application in development mode is to use the provided `launch.json` configuration in your IDE.

1.  Open the project in your IDE.
2.  Go to the "Run and Debug" panel (Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+D` or `Ctrl+Shift+D` with Cursor/VS Code).
3.  Select the **[COMPOUND] Flutter with IPC** configuration from the dropdown menu.
4.  Start debugging.

This will launch both the Flutter application and the Rust backend with the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) server, enabling them to work together.

# Clones Desktop

A desktop application for contributing to the world's largest dataset for multimodal computer-use agents. Earn $CLONES, $USDC or $SOL tokens in two ways: record your desktop interactions to train better computer-use AI, or provide secure virtual desktop infrastructure for deploying these agents.

Built from the ground up with privacy and security as core principles. See our [Privacy Policy](../../PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clones-sol/desktop.git
cd desktop
```

## Development

This project is a monorepo containing the Flutter Web application and the Rust backend integrated with Tauri.

### Prerequisites

-   [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) - Flutter 3.29+
-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:
    -   [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)
    -   [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
-   The [backend server](../projects/backend.mdx) and [website](../projects/website.mdx) must be running. Using the recommended Docker setup for both is advised.

### Application Setup (Flutter Web + Tauri)

#### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `desktop` project directory by copying the `env.example` file.

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

For local development, the default values in this file do not need to be changed.

#### 2. Run the Application

There are several ways to run the application in development mode:

##### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

Use the provided development script that handles both Flutter Web and Tauri:

```bash
./scripts/dev_web_tauri.sh
```

This script will:
- Start Flutter Web development server on port 3000
- Wait for Flutter to be ready
- Start Tauri development server
- Provide real-time logs

##### Option 2: VS Code Launch Configuration

1.  Open the project in your IDE.
2.  Go to the "Run and Debug" panel (Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+D` or `Ctrl+Shift+D` with Cursor/VS Code).
3.  Select the **[NEW] Flutter Web + Tauri Development** configuration from the dropdown menu.
4.  Start debugging.

##### Option 3: Manual Setup

Run the following commands in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Flutter Web development server
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 3000 --web-hostname 127.0.0.1

# Terminal 2: Start Tauri development server
cd src-tauri
cargo tauri dev
```

### Architecture Overview

The application now uses a unified architecture:
- **Flutter Web** application served on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Tauri** desktop wrapper with integrated Rust backend
- **IPC Server** runs within the Tauri process on port 19847
- **Hot Reload** preserved for development
- **Native distribution** via Tauri for production

This architecture provides a consistent development and production experience while maintaining all existing functionality.
